Dear Sir,
I have investor that want to invest $6.8 Billion into a company 
that needs
fund for expansion only.He can not invest the money to new 
Companies that
want to start up but into Companies that has been making good 
profits but
needs funds for EXPANSION.

His Area of concentrations are Real Estate, Biotech,Textiles , 
Information
technology, Pharmaceuticals , Oil & Energy Industries, Mining 
&Metals
Industry, Management Consulting Industry ,Maritime industry, 
Hospital &
Health Care Industry, Consumer Services Industry, International 
Trade and
Development Industry ,Gambling & Casinos Industry, Electrical/
Electronic
Manufacturing Industry, Insurance Industry, Chemical industries, 
Marketing
and Advertising Industry, Leisure, Travel & Tourism Industry, 
Agriculture,
Aviation, Retail, Import and Export, Trade and development 
industry, Real
Estate & Construction Industry and any other viable investment 
opportunities
just like yours.

If you recommend a Company to take loan or investment funds from 
my
client the investor, me and you will be entitled to 5% of any 
amount
received by the Company from the investor but if you are taking 
the fund
directly as a company i will be entitled to 2.5% and you will 
retain 2.5% as
Global Finder's fee commission.
There will be a face to face meeting between the investor and the 
investee
after signing (MOU) the (AORI) should not be less than 3% per 
annum.

Look for a reliable Company that need funding and we can easily 
make 5% of
the amount received from the investor but we need to maintain 
absolute
confidentiality in the transaction as the fund provider want to 
remain
silent, so you have to keep it highly confidential between us.
I will need the company profile and the project summary of the 
company that
will need funding to present to my investor.

I look forward to hearing from you.


Thanks
